# Java-Static-and-Non-Static


1. Static Block: A block of code that executes once when the class is first loaded, used for initializing static variables or performing setup.

2. Static Variable: A variable that is shared among all instances of a class and is initialized only once.

3. Static Method: A method that belongs to the class itself rather than any instance, and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
